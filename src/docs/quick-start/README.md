# Quick start

This guide will show you how to get started with DRY!

### Prerequisites

- npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

## Installation

The first thing you'll need to do, is add DRY to your React project. you can run:

```
npm install @comfort-order/dry --save
```

## React (v16.8+)

DRY has a couple of `peerDependencies`:

- [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

Make sure you have these installed in your project.

DRY currently runs on **React version 16**.

## Next

Let's start using some [components](components.md)!
